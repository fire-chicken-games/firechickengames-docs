Velocity : How fast the projectile moves toward its target - this should likely match or exceed the max velocity of the projectile ammo if propulsion is delayed.

The Combat module's Spawner component uses object pooling to efficiently manage multiple pools of spawnable objects. Spawner Component # A Spawner component can be added to any game object. It has built in support for spawning, despawning, and respawning based on the player's interaction with and proximity from an attached collider. Manual control of the component via Game Creator actions is also supported. Spawning # Snap to Ground # When enabled, the Y position of the spawned object is dynamically set to the ground under the object - effectively \"snapping\" the object to the terrain below. This prevents objects from being spawned under or above uneven terrain, then hovering out of site or falling (if the spawned object has a rigid body component). Pattern Type # Spawning can be done in a variety of patterns, relative to the position of the Spawner : Default Randomly places spawned objects in a developer designated radius around the Spawner . If the number of objects is sufficiently large and the spawn radius is too small/minimum spacing is too large, then objects that do not fit in the spawn area will not be spawned. Spiral Places spawned objects in a classic spiral pattern, with the center of the spiral originating at the Spawner . This pattern is useful for small clusters of objects, like a small group of ~5 enemies. Random with Overlap Randomly places spawned objects within a developer defined 3 dimensional area around the Spawner . The objects may (or may not) overlap, depending on object density in the spawn area size. This pattern is useful for spawning visual effects (e.g. flames, dust, etc.). At Spawner Origin Places all objects exactly at the Spawner's origin. This pattern is useful for spawning a single complicated prefab (rather than spawning parts of the prefab as individual spawnable items). Spawn by Weight # If enabled, a spawnable is randomly spawned using a simple weight-based selection formula. For example, if spawnable 1 has a weight of 25 and spawnable 2 has a weight of 100 , spawnable 1 will be spawned 20% of the time and spawnable 2 will be spawned 80% of the time. Spawnable 1: 25 / (25 + 100) = 20% Spawnable 2: 100 / (25 + 100) = 80% Spawnables # The list of spawnables defines which (and how many) objects are spawned by the Spawner component. If the Spawn by Weight feature is disabled, the spawnables' Weight property is disregarded. Respawning # Spawnable objects can be automatically respawned either immediately after the player re-enters the spawn zone or after a developer defined delay. Enabled # If enabled, spawned objects will be automatically respawned when the player re-enters the spawn zone. Cooldown # If enabled, a respawn will only happen after a specified number of seconds. Despawning # Despawn by Distance # If enabled, spawned objects will be automatically despawned when the player leaves the spawn zone and is a set distance from the closest spawned object. Auto-calculate Distance # If enabled, the despawning distance will be automatically computed. The auto-calculated spawn distance is the radius of an attached SphereCollider or the average height/width of an attached BoxCollider . Despawn Distance # The distance the player has to travel from the Spawner's origin before the objects are automatically despawned. This property is disregarded if Auto-calculate Distance is enabled. Game Creator Actions # A Spawner can be manually controlled with the Spawn and Despawn actions, included with the Combat module. Any standard Game Creator trigger can be used to invoke these actions. Spawn Action # Select an object that has a Spawner component as the actions target. Disable the Despawn by Distance option when manually controlling the Spawner with triggers/actions, or the objects will never appear to spawn.

The Z and C keys are used to switch targets. Please note that these keys can be remapped .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"combat/targeting/targetable/","text":"Making game objects targetable using the Combat module\u2019s Targetable component is trivial for Game Creator Characters and other game objects. Basic Setup # Characters # To make a character targetable, simply add the Targetable component to it. Non-Character Game Objects # Any game object can be targetable if it has the Targetable , Rigidbody , and Collider components. Making a Target Untargetable # The Targetable component contains a boolean Game Creator Variable property, called Can Be Targeted , that can make the target untargetable. For example, once the target has been defeated, it is likely desirable for the player to automatically stop targeting it and not be able to target it again. This is accomplished by: Adding a boolean Local Variable to a character (e.g. \"IsAlive\"). Assigning the boolean variable to the Can Be Targeted property. In the character\u2019s On Receive Shot Actions , set the boolean value to false - this will deselect the target and make it no longer targetable. The Combat Examples module\u2019s Example4-KillableCharacters demo scene contains a pre-configured KillableCharacter prefab. It demonstrates how to make a character killable/untargetable using the method described above. Visibility Detection Renderer This property is used to determine if a Targetable's mesh is visible to a Targeter component. It does not normally need to be manually set (if not set, the component uses the first renderer found in the object's hierarchy). This property only needs to be manually set if the Targetable component's parent object does not have a mesh renderer in its hierarchy, or a mesh renderer other than the first one the GetComponentInChildren<Renderer>() returns by default is required. If visibility features are not used, this property can be ignored completely. \"On Target Become Untargetable\" Trigger # New in 0.4.0 There is also a trigger called \"On Target Become Untargetable\" that allows for actions to be executed when the target becomes untargetable. The Combat Examples module\u2019s Example7-DestructibleTargets demo scene contains a pre-configured DestructibleTarget prefab. It showcases how to use this trigger to implement destructible targets. Advanced Options # Active Target Indicator # The Targetable component provides an \"indicator\" feature that highlights the currently targeted game object. The content and appearance of the indicator is configurable. Text # An indicator can have custom text, defined via a Game Creator Global/Local Variable . Practically speaking, it almost always makes sense to use a Local Variable packaged in the same prefab object that contains the Targetable component. The value of the Local Variable would then be configured on the instance of the prefab when used in a scene.

The example indicator has text above a downward pointing arrow. Positioning # The target indicator is positioned relative to the parent game object. By default, the Indicator Offset vector will position the indicator above the Game Creator example character, but may need to be adjusted for other characters and objects of with heights. Targeting Actions # A Targetable game object can optionally execute actions when it becomes the active target, and another set of actions when some other object becomes the active target (or targeting is toggled off altogether). \"On Become Active Target\" # When the target becomes the active target, these actions can (for example) make the target crouch.
